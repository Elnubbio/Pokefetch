# Pokefetch
Pokemon stats and image fetch application

What this project is:
A command line application that fetches data from https://pokeapi.co/ to return statistics as a txt file and multiple image files of user given pokemon names.

How I will start:
Need to take user input so import inquirer module
Need to save files so import fs/promises and path

First create a variable with a pokemon name then create a function to handle fetching the data
Check if the fetch works or not, return the relevant error
Create functions to interpret the data, manipulate strings for the output and creating txt files and images
